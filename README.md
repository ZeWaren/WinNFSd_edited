Original Description
--------------------
WinNFSd is a Network File System (NFS) server for Windows. You can use any NFS client to mount a directory of Windows and read/write files via NFS protocol. It is useful when you usually access files of Windows on Linux.

Additional features
-------------------
Can export any folder with an alias. This can be very useful if you quickly need to share a directory using NFS on a Windows computer, without installing anything.
Example: export `c:\truc\machin` as `/`.
